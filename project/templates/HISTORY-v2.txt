*******************************************************************************

wit v2.00a r2834 - 2011-07-08

 - Because no bugs (exclude installing) reported since months my WIT tools
   seems to be perfect (or ready to use or something between). So it's time
   to increase the major version and to proclaim v2.00a. The whole project
   consists about 100 000 code lines.
 - Bug fix for Windows install script: Remove duplicate WIT entries.


wit v2.00b r2855 - 2011-07-13
 - Bug fix: If creating a Wii image and using hard links (option --links) the
   offsets of some hard linked files are wrong for some special situations.


wit v2.01a r3138 - 2011-10-27

 - Windows version only: Update to Cygwin DLL 1.7.9-1
 - Bug fix (thanx to fig2k4): Special characters in FST file names with code
   >127 will now be translated into UTF-8 to list and create files correct.
 - New option for "wwt LIST": --fragments: Print fragments and a ratio instead
   of the region info. A summary line is printed too.
 - New command: wwt LIST-F|LF: Short cut for "wwt LIST --fragments"
 - Option --sort=fragments sort some listings by the number of wbfs fragments.
 - Option --fast is ignored and will be removed in the near future.
   Please don't use --fast any longer.
 - New option: --copy-gc: If extracting a GameCube disc image, don't extract
   the real files to '/files/...'. Instead create a copy of the source image
   and store it as 'game.iso'. If the source image have the correct format and
   option --no-link is not set, try a hard link first.
 - Option --neek replaces the old --sneek, but --sneek is also accepted.
   Option --neek includes now option --copy-gc.
 - "wit extract --neek --dest %i": Extract like DiscEx (but faster!).
   The only change is for GameCube discs because of implied --copy-gc.


wit v2.02a r3240 - 2011-11-25

 - The default output filename for WBFS files changed from "ID6.wbfs" ("%+")
   to "TITLE [ID6].wbfs" ("%X").
 - The file order for composed files is now Nintendo like.
 - If extracting an image, a new files called 'align-files.txt' is created. It
   stores information about file alligning. If creating a new image and option
   --align-files is set, this file is read to align files, that have a previous
   aligning of >=0x8000 (Wii sector size). This fixes the bug for "Super Paper
   Mario" and perhaps for some other games.
 - wit FILES: If the file list is sorted by offset, than an 'unused' column is
   added before the 'offset' column.
 - wfuse for Mac is back again. It was lost because non installed FUSE package.


wit v2.03a r3309 - 2011-12-30

 - wit+wwt SKELETON: Support of GameCube images.
 - New command: wwt DUP: Duplicate an existing WBFS to a new file including
   block assigning errors. The idea is to have a command, that can duplicate
   a defect WBFS for tests.
 - Command "wwt DUMP" accept now --show for a fine control of printed data.
   The dump may now contain also a usage table and a integrity check report.

 - For a long time the code contains a WBFS extension. Now I have xompleted,
   enabled and tested it. With this extension the WBFS "free blocks table" is
   managed in a total different way:
    - WBFS access: While opening a WBFS the free blocks table is ignored.
      Instead of using the stored one an internal memory map of used blocks is
      built. This needs only a part of a second. Some advantages:
       - Errors in the free blocks table are irrelevant.
       - Blocks overlaps and invalid block assignings are automatically
         detected, reported, and fixed for internal usage.
       - If removing a discs with overlaps, the blocks are still marked used.
       - Blocks, that are not handled by the free blocks tables (the table is
         sometimes too small; a result of a calculation bug in the original
         libwbfs) can be used. If closing a WBFS, a new and fixed free blocks
         table will be written. This makes the whole process compatible and
         transparent to other WBFS managers and USB loaders.
    - wwt ADD: Before adding a disc, its size is compared against the free size
      of the WBFS. This allows an early "disc full" error message.
    - wwt ADD: If adding a disc to a partition a continuous memory block is
      searched to minimize the (non existent) fragmentation. This is disabled
      for WBFS files by default because a file itself can be fragmented.
    - wwt ADD+PHANTOM --wbfs-alloc=mode: Set the WBFS block allocation mode.
    - The commands "wwt CHECK", "wwt REPAIR" and "wwt EDIT" have been modified
      to work with the new interface.


wit v2.04a r3554 - 2012-03-10

 - New option: wit --force: Ignore partition size errors and allow access to
   damaged partitions. "wwt --force" works similar.
 - New options: --disc-id=id, --boot-id=id, --ticket-id=id, --tmd-id=id and
   --wbfs-id=id: Patch only the specific ID. These options are handled after
   the --id and --modify options. Patching the WBFS ID while adding a game is
   now also possible.
 - New implementation of command "wit ID6": It generates an ID6 list of all
   sources. This is similar as before, only the meaning of the parameters
   changed. If option --long is set, a table with 5 IDs (DISC, BOOT, TICKET,
   TMD and WBFS) is printed. BOOT, TICKET and TMD IDs are taken from the main
   partition. If --long is set twice, all IDs of all partitions are printed.
 - wwt LLLL: List contains date and time (in seconds) columns.


wit v2.05a r3591 - 2012-04-14

 - "wit VERIFY" will now ignore extracted file systems.
 - wit --id=.....X: ID change failed if only the sixt character was modified.
 - All ID patching options (--id, --disc-id, ...) accept now a plus sign '+' as
   wildcard for multiple '.' to fill the complete entered ID to 4/6 characters.
 - The listing command "wit ID6" accepts now all ID patching options to test
   the effect of them.


wit v2.05b r3611 - 2012-04-20

 - Bug fix for assertion failure in "wwt RECOVER".


wit v2.06a r3832 - 2012-06-15

 - Windows version only: Update to Cygwin DLL 1.7.15-1
 - wit CERT --long: Print keys and signatures as hex or base64 dump.


wit v2.07a r3955 - 2012-07-14

 - Bug fix: The automatic directory creation if using %-escapes in destination
   file names was gone and is now back again.
 - Bug fix: Extracting files of directories beginning with '.' fails sometimes.
 - Bug fix: "wit edit --id=... a.wbfs" may now change the WBFS id too.
 - Bug fix: wwt (but not wit) ignored the parameter of option --include-path.
 - Because of compiler warnings: Switched from utime() to utimes().


wit v2.08a r4027 - 2012-08-31

 - New command: wit IMGFILES: Print a list (1 file per line) with all image
   files inlcuding their associated split files. If option --null (-0) is set,
   the list is NULL terminated to support all possible file names.
 - New command: wit REMOVE: Removes the image files including their associated
   split files.
 - New option --scan-progress: Print a log message is printed for each found
   image while scanning the local file system.
 - Bug fix: "wit COPY --source a --dest b" threw an error, because the tool
   thought, that no source was defined.
 - Bug fix for "wwt ADD --raw": wwt copied too large (double layer) images.


wit v2.09a r4047 - 2012-09-08

 - Option --scan-progress prints more info and flush every log output.
 - Bug fix: "wit MOVE a.wbfs ..." will work now.
 - New escapes for output files: The old '%f' is the source filename without
   path (like 'name.ext'). Now we have also '%g' and '%h' as split of '%f':
   '%g' is file name without extension ('name') and '%h' is the extension
   ('.ext').
 - Bug fix: "wit COPY --recurse a --dest b" threw an error, because the tool
   thought, that no source was defined (same as with --source before).


wit v2.09b r4053 - 2012-09-09

 - Bug fix: Because of the --recurse bug fix of v2.08a, "wit COPY" failed.


wit v2.10a r4118 - 2012-10-10

 - Write privileges are not longer needed, if a WBFS file or partiton is only
   read.
 - New command: wit ANAID (ANAlyze ID): Analyze the entered IDs and print one
   line for each ID with 3 columns: HEX_ID, ASCII_ID, Game title.
 - Little (compatible) changes for WDF v1.
 - New command: wit FRAGMENTS: Print the image fragments and, if possible,
   their filesystem mapping. Add option --brief (-b) to print only a summary
   with the fragment counts. Add option --long (-l) to print additonally
   alignment infos.
   *NOTE: Filesystem mapping is only supported on real linux systems (yet),
          but neither for Mac nor for Cygwin.
 - The image builder search now the file 'exclude.fst' to exclude files from
   the composing. See https://wit.wiimm.de/info/composing.html#part for details.


wit v2.11a r4233 - 2013-02-09

 - Windows version only: Update to Cygwin v1.7.17
 - Bug fix: A wrong TMD size is now detected while scanning image partitions.
 - Command 'wit FRAGMENTS' will now scan and print the filesystem mapping for
   Linux (like before) and Windows (that's new). Mac is still not supported.


wit v2.12a r4272 - 2013-03-14

 - Bug fix: "wit EDIT" failed on WBFS files since v2.10a (Write privileges
   not longer needed for WBFS files).
 - New command: wwt SCRUB: Scrubs an image and free unused WBFS blocks. It can
   be combined with --psel= to clear unwanted image partitions. This command
   may help to repair wrong WBFS block maps.
 - New wfuse option: --allow-other (-O): This option is a short cut for
   '-o allow_other'. It enables re-exporting of the mounted file system for
   example by a samba server.


wit v2.13a r4298 - 2013-03-28

 - New docu file: INSTALL.txt
 - Mac+Linux+Unix: Script 'install.sh' will call itself with 'sudo' if not
   started by user 'root'. Read INSTALL.txt for details.
 - Windows: Cygwin updated.
 - Bug fix: If writing an image failed ('disc full' for example), the tools
   didn't aborted and, if option --remove was set, deleted the source image.
   This bug arrived with the implementation of preallocation, because of a
   lost error status.


wit v2.20a r4399 - 2013-05-01

 - After 4 years development this version should be the last release of the
   WIT-Tools until further notice; with exception of bug fix releases. I will
   discontinue adding new features. That's the reason for the little version
   jump to v2.20a.
 - New command: "wwt NEW" is a short cut for "wwt ADD --update --newer".
 - Cygwin (Windows) DDLs updated.
 - Title data base updated.


wit v2.21a r4489 - 2013-06-15

 - The default image format switched from WDF to WBFS. This is only relevant,
   if no image type is specified by source, option or file extension, for
   example for the command "wwt EXTRACT".
 - wit DUMP --long: If dumping a DOL file, a third table with delta values
   between the virtual address and the file offset is printed.
 - New command: wit DOLPATCH: Patch a DOL file by reading a Riivolution XML
   file and scanning all memory tags.
   -> Read https://wit.wiimm.de/cmd/wit/dolpatch for details.
 - If extracting an image, the file 'setup.txt' contains now a new parameter:
   "image-type = TYPE". It shows the image type of the source image.
   If cretaing an image and file 'setup.txt' contains this paramater with a
   valid image type, this image type is used as default for the new created
   image. The default is superseded by format options and file extensions.
     This feature is dedicated to patching scripts. If an original image is
   extracted with "wit extract -1n ANYID6 . WORKDIR --psel data" and then
   patched, an image with identical image type as the original can be created
   by the command: wit copy WORKDIR %x --id NEWID6 --name "new title of game"
 - For easier script/batch support, the files "setup.sh" and "setup.bat" are
   created for extracted images. They contain similar info as "setup.txt", but
   can be directly included by ". ./PATH/setup.sh" or  "CALL PATH\setup.bat"
   to get the settings as script variables.
 - Cygwin (Windows) DDLs updated.
 - Title data base updated.


wit v2.21b r4492 - 2013-06-15

 - Bug fix: wit DOLPATCH: Reading 'offset' failed on 32 bit systems.


wit v2.22a r4516 - 2013-06-22

 - Command "wit DOLPATCH" accepts now more commands and is able to create new
   TEXT and DATA sections.
   -> Read https://wit.wiimm.de/cmd/wit/dolpatch for details.
 - New option: --tt-id=ID: This is a short cut for '--ticket=ID --tmd=ID'.
   If TICKET and TMD differ, the game will freeze after loading. So it make
   sense to change only TICKET and TMD IDs together.
 - Bug fix, if using "wit COPY --name discname" and the destination is %X or
   similar: The new discname is now used to create the filename.


wit v2.22b r4520 - 2013-06-22

 - Command "wit DOLPATCH":
    - Bug fix: If loading a file, wrong data was used.
    - Tag 'memory', attribute 'value': 4 MiB data are accepted now.
    - Sub command 'address=hexstring': 4 MiB data are accepted now.


wit v2.23a r4534 - 2013-07-12

 - Bug fix: wit DOLPATCH: Conditions were ignored.
   (Already fixed in unofficial v2.22c)
 - Built-in docu.
 - Title data base updated.
 - Windows only: Cygwin update to v1.7.20 2013-06-07.
 - Some makefile changes because of a new Cygwin compiler.


wit v2.24a r4723 - 2013-11-10

 - The Windows installer will now force type REG_EXPAND_SZ for path variables.
 - wit DOLPATCH: Wrong calculation for address aligning fixed.
 - New sub command for "wit DOLPATCH": ENTRY=address: Define a new entry point.
 - Title data base updated.
 - Windows version only: Update to Cygwin v1.7.25. I hope that it fixes the
   bug that occurred during creation of MKW-Fun 2013-10 with Windows 8.1.


wit v2.25a r4825 - 2014-01-03

 - New option --auto-split: If set, the tools try to find out, if an image
   split is needed. The split size is then either below 4 or 2 GiB. Auto-Split
   base on tests with fseek() and works fine under Linux, but it don't work
   with Cygwin. Mac is unknown. In future versions --auto-split is enabled by
   default. It is disabled by any other split option.
 - New option --no-split: Disable file splitting at all. At the moment and in
   old versions of the tools, this is the default.
 - wwt CHECK+REPAIR: Support for option --sections.
 - Windows only: Cygwin update to v1.7.27 2013-12-09.


wit v2.26a r4863 - 2014-01-22

 - Bug fix: Because of a bug after implementing the auto split detection,
   reading source images failed, if using stdin for parameters.
 - Support for Dolphins file format GCZ (GameCube Zip):
    - All commands detect and accept GCZ files as input file.
    - Creating of GCZ files is also supported, but EXPERIMENTAL until final
      tests have been done.
    - New option --gcz force GCZ output.
    - Patching of GCZ files is not possible, because the GCZ file structure
      doesn't allow modifications (size of compressed data must not change).
    - Composing an image to a GCZ file is not possible, because it needs
      patching checksums and header after writing the complete image.
   The GCZ support is very new, so please use it only with backups of your
   images and don't be anger, if it destroy something.


wit v2.27a r4908 - 2014-01-31

 - Bug fix: If extracting a GameCube image, files larger than 4 MiB are
   damaged at beginning of this 4 MiB offset.
 - New feature: If creating a GCZ image, a blockwise z-compression is tried.
   If the compressed data is larger than 98.5%, the uncompressed data is
   stored. New is, that encrypted blocks are stored directly as uncompressed
   data, because encrypted are very bad compression candidates and the 98.5%
   test fails all the time. This makes GCZ creation faster. The new option
   --gcz-zip disables this optimization for encrypted data.
 - New option: --gcz-block=size: Define the block size for GCZ creation. The
   default size is 16K (also Dolphins default).
 - Tool 'wdf' supports info dumps of GCZ files to verify the GCZ creation.
 - New command for wit+wwt: FEATURES: Print a list of supported features. The
   output is machine readable. Scripts may use "wit features -qq" and check
   the exit status.
 - Reading support for the comming WDF v2. Details: https://wit.wiimm.de/WDF
   Writing support will follow, if EDIT is implemented too.


wit v2.28a r4980 - 2014-03-01

 - Full WDF version 2 support:
    - WDFv2 files are a little bit smaller and support alignment.
    - Parts of the WDF library have been rewritten to support WDFv2 and
      alignment. A side effect is a more compact code and a better chunk
      management if modifiying WDF files.
    - Option --wdf forces WDF output, the version is definied automatically.
    - Option --wdf1 forces WDFv1 output.
    - Option --wdf2 forces WDFv2 output.
    - Option --align-wdf defines an alignment between 1 and 1GiB (power of 2)
      and optional the minimal hole size before creating a new chunk.
    - 'wit EDIT' supports --wdf1 and --wdf2 to allow version conversions.
   For technical details about WDF see: https://wit.wiimm.de/WDF
 - Support of split files of CleanRip: If reading a plain ISO file named
   '*.part0', the other parts are detected as continuation files.
 - Windows only: Cygwin update to v1.7.28 2014-02-09.


wit v2.29a r5186 - 2014-05-16

 - New patching options to support the new custom server:
   - Option --http: Replace 'https' request to 'http' in the files 'main.dol'
     and 'rel/StaticR.rel'.
   - Option --domain=dom: Replace 'nintendowifi.net' by the new domain.
   - Option --wiimmfi: Patch the images for the new custom server. It is a
     short cut for: --http --domain=wiimmfi.de


wit v2.30a r5771 - 2014-11-15

 - Bug fix for GameCube extracts: The alignments in file 'align-files.txt'
   were too large by a factor of 4.
 - WDF version 2 is now the default WDF version. Use --wdf1 to force v1.
 - With v2.21a (June 2013) the default output file format was switched from
   WDF to WBFS. Since that command SKELETON used this new default by mistake.
   Now the much more efficient WDFv2 is used as default for skeletons.
 - Command SKELETON supports now GameCube images.
 - Windows only: Cygwin update to v1.7.32 2014-08-13.


wit v2.31a r6005 - 2015-02-08

 - Some minor text edits.
 - Title database updated.
 - Windows only: Cygwin update to v1.7.34-6 2015-02-04.


wit v2.40a r7331 - 2017-01-05

 - This will be the last release of v2.* series. I plan to reorganize the code
   and to use my own C source library and to integrate Wii U support.
 - New command: wit ID8: Print ID6 + 2 next bytes as disc and version number.
 - Title database: Definitions without titles (e.g. "RMCP =") will remove the
   related title from the internal title database. If a ID is followed by a
   star (e.g. "RMC* ="), then all titles beginning with the ID are removed.
 - Title database updated.
 - Some minor text edits.
 - Windows only: Cygwin update to v2.6.1 2016-12-16.
